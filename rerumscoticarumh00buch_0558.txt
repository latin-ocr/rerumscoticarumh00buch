of Oetober that year from Edinburgh ς
In it she acknowledges the pope’s savour
and bounty to her ε ‚she adds some high
expreffions of her sense of the pope's zeal
and piety 3 and promises to treat his nun-
cio with all respeft and confidence. The
nuncio came to Paris in the d0g⁶days‚
and brought him who writes his life a·
long with him to be his secretary. He
received letters from the queen of Scots
by the hands of the archbishop of Glas-
gow, who was then her ambaffador in
Ἴ France : by these she expressed her desire
that he might come to Scotland as soon
as might ¹be3 but wished him to delay
coming, till he should hear from her once
more, that she might have all things pre-
pared for his reception. Upon that he
wrote to her in a very vehement stile‚pres-
sing her to zeal and fortitude of mind, in
carrying on the restoring the catholic re-
ligion in her kingdom z vt ith that he sent
herl over 4000 crowns‚ and sent one Ed-
mund Hay, a jesuit, and a man ofa cuu-
ning ,and penetrating temper, to be a se·
cret assistant to her. Three months pas-
sed before Laurea had any intimation
from the queen concerning his coming 0-
. vers upon which he sent th}i bishop of
Durnblanem⁴h0 was then atPariS‚with co-
pious advices to that queen, and continu-
ed to press her very earnestly by his letters,
t> admit of his coming over. The author
ofhis life tells us further, that the queen
held a conventiou of the estates, and had
obtained two things of them not without
difficulty :v the one was, that her child
should be baptized according to the rites
oftheRomanchurch3 and the other was,

A that the pope’s nuncio should be admitted

¹with due respect. Upon this the nuncio
designed to go to Antwerp‚ thinking that
Ι the navigation would be safer from thence
than from Calais. But then the author
of his life adds, that such a barbarous
and impious crime was committed in Scot -
land, that it gave a horror to think of it,
much more to write of it, meaning the
.. murder of the king. When this base

murder was known, continues he, all

 

people were struck with horrour : Some,

spoke severely of the queen hereself3 li-
bels were published upon it3 and some
. having discovered that Bothwell was the
author of this horrid murder, they charg—
ed him as being not only, an asshffin, but

” a cruel‘ hangman. The queen loved him

’ desperately ς, ⁴therefore he in hope to
'be married to her, first divor'ced his wife,

as if upon adultery that might be so dorae,
that he might marry another wife,- and
then he cruelly contrived the murder of
the king. The queen after she had born
down some very wicked reports concern-
ing herself and Bothwell, being afraid of

'some tumult, that might have been fatal

to them, thought fit to leave Edinburgh ε
so she carried herson with her to Sterlin„
a place of defence3 having laid (as is pro--.
bable) a defign with Bothwell how mat-
ters were to be managed. A few days af-
ter she pretended to go out a hunting, ,
when Bothwell with 200 horse‘seemed,
to surprize her, and to seize her by force. ’
But the queen coming back with him to· ’
the castle, presently made him dulce of.
Orkney, and declared him her husband.
That marriage did not prove happy nor
lasting ε it being a conjunctior] that had
nothing ofvthe matrimonial dignity in it, .
but had sprung from a partnership in an
unworthy crime. The people were uni-
versally enraged against the queen and
Bothwell, and their minds wrought up
to a great flame : therefore a tumultuary,
army being iu haste brought together at
Edinburgh, they marched towards Ster-
ling. But when the queen heard that,
she, with a few women, and some of her
court went to them. They received her
with due respest z and being asked why
they carne thither armed ? they answer-
ed, they came only to punish Bothwell‚ ’
for the crimes committed by him, both Δ

in the base and cruel murder of the king, , ,ἢ
and in the force he had put upon her ‚

person. The queen justified Bothwell 3.
and said, he had done nothing but byher
consent ι this did provoke them to such

a degree os indignafion, that they cried ‘¹
all out, with one voice, Then, Madam, 0 „
you shall beffour prisoner. Thus the pope’s Α ‚ ἱ

nuncio understood this matte‘r. There ⁶

are some inconfiderable circumstances in ’ζ’

this relation wrong told, yet the main 'oh ;{

the story agre'eing with other relations, ‘j

{hews how falssy this matter has been ψ

since that time represented, not only by .
writers in the church of Rome, but by
many among ourselves, to put better co·
lours on this odious business. Cardinal ι
Laurea may be supposed to have had the*

best information that he could procures. . '

from those of queen Mary's party, and of Α
her religion, and he would certainly 'have
put the best face poffible on thas matter ς ·
especially after h'er tragical fate, <which
