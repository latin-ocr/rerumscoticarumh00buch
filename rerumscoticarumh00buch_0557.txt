„LIBER Dec-musaeum& 541,

rvui-reulus, aut alius amicorum ea de re expostulet, aut earn vitio ei

verta-ht.

Nunc enim rebus ita transactis, ut inscelae fieri non pollintz,
‘ “ in meliorem partem omnia accepimus : δί ut est re vera, ita maritus

noster est existimandus, quem dehinc ἀ* amare, δι colere decrevi. Qi-
cunque autem se profitentur nostros amicos, (i) similem erga eum se
profiteri necefl'e est, qui insolubili vinculo nobiscum conjunctus est.
Qanquam nonnullis in rebus paulo negligentius, ac pene temerarie
se gesserit, quod immoderatae erga nos affectioni libenter imputamus,
cupimus tamen ut Rex, Regina, noster avunculus, ac caeteri amici e·
um non minore prosequantur benevolentia, quarn fi omnia ad hunc-
hsque diem ex eorum praescripto transacta fuiss'ent : eumque centra.
promittimus in omnibus, quae ab eo postulabuntur, semper gratificari

paratum(z).”

(1) Here we may either allow an el-
lipse of amicitiam, as amicos nostros goes
immediately before t, or understand 1t as
put partitively, in which case the singular
as well as the plural number is used, as
Plaut. Arriphit. 1. 1. 76, 77. pro se quis-
que id quod quisque potest, δε valet, E-
dit t ferro ferit ι tela frangunt t Id Pseu-
dol. 3. 2. 93, 4. ut quisque quidque con-
ditum gustaverit, Ipsos fibi fariam u't di-
gitos praerodant suos.

(2) Our author has left out the two
last paragraphs of these instructions to
queen Mary's trusty counsellor‚ William
Chisholm bissiop of Du-mblane, dated at
Edinburgh the day of lvlay 1567.
which are as follows.

 

⁷ ‘⁴ Item, in case ir. {hall be objecredv to
you by the king, the queen our mother,
our uncle, or any other our⁴ friends, that
our present marriage cannot be lawful,
in respect that he whom withal we are
presently joined, was of before coupled to
a wife t ye {hall rep-ly and anfwer accor-
‚ding to the very truth, that albeit he was

3 before married, yet before our marriage

with him, the former contra& and band
was by the order of law, expresl'ed in the
canons received and praEtised in our re-
alm, for lawful cause of consanguinity,
and others relevant, diffolved, and the

vprocess ofdivorce orderlyled 3 so that :ve γ

on the one part, aad he on the other fide,
being both free, rhe marriage might law-
fully and well enough be accomplished
by the law-s ofnhisoealm, as now atGod's
pleasure it iS, whereby the foresaid ob-

* jestiom or any other the like tending to
this fyne [end‚] may be elydit and set by.
“ Furthermore‚ it may be that our un-
cle the cardinal ssmllpbjcst andfind fault,
that we made not such exa& diligence in
convoying hither of the NunceApostolice
as the weight of the matter craved ε 111
- which point γε shall answer and satisfy
him by declaration. and making os true

report, how this last year about Martimes,
we directed toward the said Nunce our
well-beloved clerk and lervitour Mr. Ste-
vin Wilfoun, instruerer} wtth our mind,
whereof the chief intent was, how the
Nunce might be most surely and conve-
niently transported toward our realm,
and to our presence, by the conduct of
our said servitour 5 and yet we saw no ap-
pearance of his coming, but is partly frus-
trate and put by our purpose, for latk of
that support which once we understood of
his 11a11n2ss' liberality to haye been desti-
nate for us for the maintaining osour e-
stare,and forthsetting of our authority3 but
chiefly in default os his presence, counsel

and conference with him, which joined ⁷

with the other thing before said, in all
appearance was not only likely to have
furthered and advanced the matter very
highly, but also might have red [rid] us
out of many thrawart [σοῖς] accidents
which sensyne we havc fallen into3 one
of the principal occasions whereos we
must impute to the said nuncio's absence,
and not reforting to us, which has pro· ’
ceeded on his own motion, and sore a·-
gainst our will, as γε shall make our u· -
cleto understand, by all the good and ho·
nest pertaafions ye can, ‘tending to this
end.'’

These instructions, which are couched
with much art, will be sufficicntly unfol-
ded by the following relation.

Pope Pius V. sent Vincent de Laum,
then bissiop of Mondovi‚ afterwards caz-
dinal, to be his nuncio in Scotland, to as·
fist and encourage the queen in her de-
fign of bringing back her kingdom to the
obedience of the holy see. He sent by

him 20‚000 crowns to her, as an earneit' '

offui-ther supplies, and wrote to her with
his own hand, june 16. 1556. recom-
mending his nuncio to her confidence.
