(r) The laird ofOrmiflon.

(2) He was first called sir Alexander
Setun, younger son to Seton of that ilk z
he married Elizabeth cordon, daughter
and heir to the iord Gordon, and taking
upon him the name of Gordon, was ty
king James ll. made carl of l-lnntly; his
son married-Jean Stewart, sister to king
James 11. 'l'his is Mr. Crawford's note,
which seems to consound tlte father with
the son and grandson. l-'or in the foedera
Angliae, there is a safe condo-ft in 1421
sor Alexander Seton, lord of Gordon,
coming into England 3 and next year,
being in England, there is a fase con·
du& for him paliing and going tn Rou-
τη, to the presence of james, king of
Scots z and tlte year after that :t conduct
for his coming into England to the king's
touncil. Hc was one of the hossages for
the payment of James rst's ransom, his
yearly ‘rents and posse-mons being then va-
lued onlj· at 4co merks, whereas those of
Thom:s carl of Murray and Alexr. eatl
‹thrawford were rati-d each at a 1000.
For tho* Straloch thinks this Alexr. Se-
ton was not married to the heiress, till as-
ter the battle of Harlaw 1411, at which
hc was present, yet he must have been too
far advanccd in years to have been able
to perform ‚such warlike exploits as are

here ascribed to the earl of Huntly. It
must therefore have been his son Alexan- ¹
der, who ass‘umed the firname of Gordon,
and was created first 'carl of Huntly in
1449, that fought the battle of Brechin ι -
οη whom there is an encomium ofour
author's which has never yet been print-
ed, of which Ι have two copies, one in
the hand of Mr. Robert Gordon ufstra-
loch, and another sent me from a gentle·
man in Edinburgh ε And tho* the form-
er wants the penult distich, and iri-the-
last line has animam for animum, its ti-
tle seems to bc juster than that of the o-
ther ς unless we suppose the poem to have
been composcd on Alexander the third
carl, second of the name of Alexander,
wlzo was chance-lior to king James tv,
and one of his generals at the battle of
Flowdon,and one of the governors of the* ·
kingdom, during the absence os the duke
of Albany regent to James V. At the
time of this third earl's death, which
happened in 1523, out· author was about
17 years of age, and ifthe following epi· ·
taph was defigned for this third earl, it '
may have been one of his first ess'ays in
poetry. 1t was George the second earl, 'J
father of this Alexr. the third earl, that ³5
married Jean Stcwart, daughter to king
james 1. formerly countess of Angue.
