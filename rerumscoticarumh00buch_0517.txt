the loch of Rothemorcus ε the rest ofthe
clan apprehended him, and put him and
she partners of his crime to ‘a deserved
death. Upon this the elan chose Hector
‘MacIntossu a bastard of the family, for
their chieftain, till his nephew were of
fit age, who was the ear} of Murray's

care of the Ogilvies, his mother’s relati·

the boy in his own power, all being of
the mind that he defigned to destroy him,

author in another place, after an account
of Huntly's putting this excellent gentle-
