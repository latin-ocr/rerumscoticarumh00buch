tim inopinato eventu ringi, partim ridere : nec quisquam omnium ea
immerenti accidisse credere.

LI. Eisdem forte diebus Bothuelius ex intimis ministris unum in
arcem Edimburgensem misit, qui arculam argenteam literis undique
inscriptam, quae indicarent, eam aliquando Francisci Regis franco·
rum luisse, ad se deferrer. ln ea inerant literae Reginae ipsius manu
pene omnes scriptae, in quibus Sc caedes Regis, ὃς caetera fere omnia,
quae consecuta· sunt, dilucide continebantur : ac pene in singulis scrip-⁴
tum erat, ut lec‘iae statim cremarentur. Verum BothueliuS, qui Regi-
nae inconstantiam nosset, ut cujus intra paucos annos plurima viderat
exempla, literas conservarat, ut li quid diffidii cum ea incidisset, illo
testimonio uteretur, nec ,se Regiae caedis auclorem, sed comitem fuisse
ostenderet. Hanc arculam Botliuelii ministro Balfurius ferendam de-
dit ι sed prius principibus adversae partis admonitis, quid, per quem,
δι quov mitteretur. Ea deprehensa, multas, magnasque res etsi mag-

ἱ ni„ suspitionibus jaeiatas', tamen nondum satis detestas in lucem ¹pro·

tulit, universamque crimen pene oculis subjecit.

Lss. Bothuel-ius rebus ubique male cedentibus, omni auxilio, ac ,
spe recuperandi regni destitutuS, primum ad Orcadas, deinde ad
Hethlandicas insulas profugit : ibique rerum omnium inopia circ'um-
ventus piraticam facere coepit. Regina. vern, multis orantibus, ut
causam suam a, Bothuelio separaret (supplicio enim de eo sumpto, fo-
re, ut omnium civium summa voluntate ipsa facile restitueretur) mu-
lier ferox, & pristinae fortunae spiritus? gerens„ δι malis praesentibus ef-
ferata respondit,¹ se libentius cum illo in extremis fostunae adversantis
angustiis, quam sine eo in Regiis deliciis vitam acturam-(1) ’

asked the loreis, if he might in their name
