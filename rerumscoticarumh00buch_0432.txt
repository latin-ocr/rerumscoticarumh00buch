(ι) He had killed the laird of Meld-
rum, Seaton, very treacheroussy in Aber-
deen, in the Provost's house, who died
penult. Janmry 1536-7. The following
detail may serve for a farther confirmati-
on of what is here mentioned by our au-
thor in general terms. From time im-
memorial there had been a contra& be-
twixt the town of Aberdeen and the lord
Forbes's predeceffors, by which the town
was bound to pay lord Forbes a tunof
wine per annum, and he to cause keep
the black fifh of their waters in undne or
forbidden time, and punish the ssayers
thereos according to law z but in May
1530 the lord Forbes claiming the wine
on account of a half net's salmon fishing
on Don, to which he pretended a right,
tho’ it appears he had none, about which
the town writ him a very smart letter,
the quarrcl soon rose to such a height
that it came to be ‹lebated by the point os
the sword. On the penult of July that
year, being a sabbath-day, agreat number
of the rorheses, headed by Alexander For·
bes younger of Bru—x, invaded the town.
The inhabitants rose in arms to the num-
ber of 5005, chased young Brux to the
friars place, and there befieged him sor
24 hours ; and there was blood {hed on
both fides. In the beginning* of August
the town was ordered tobe fortified with a
wall and fosse, and artillery and ammu-
nition to be provided sos· defien‘ee. against
the lord Forbes and his srie'nds. Both
'parties raised criminal letters against each
other sor sore-thought felony, ssaughter
and mutilatio‘n, first the For-beten against
the town, above 20 of whose inhabitante
were comiti-ed by an affize at Lithgow,
August 17· os wounding Brux younger
end othei· two Foxbeses, qs robbing him

Rex non adeo multo post velut poenitentia duCtus,

os his horses and killing his lervant'.
Whereu‘pon the town council passed an
a& that no penfion should be given in
time coming to the lord Forbes or any o·
ther-s for keepingof their waters, because
they that should be keepers were princi-
pal destroyers and fishers of them in une
due tiriae 3 protesting, that is any such·
penfion wer-'e given‚·it should be holden as
reisand black mail. And in December
t'he same year, the town raised letters of
lawboroughs against the Forbese's os Pet->
sscgow‚ Toquhone‚ Co‘rffinday, Bmx,
Towie‚ Barness, Kinellar', Auchintoilegv
Tuliegony, letis, and their accomplif-
ces, particularly John son and apparent
heir to Thomas Sti-athachin of Lenturk
(probably the same naughty person whom ,
o'ur author knew at Paris during his ex·
ile) and his sather's brothers. And at
Perth on the 12th of the same mouth-,3
John lord Forbes gave in to the lords os
council his bond os lawborough for him·-
seff, John master of* Forbes his son, and
the rest of his sons, that Philorth, the
provost and town of Aberdeen should be
harmless of him, &c. under the pain os
50001. to be paid to the king. Five ⁴
years after this Mr. Alexr. Forbes, par—
son os forbes‚xin name of John lord For-
bes, demanded of the magistrates a tun of
wine, conform to the town's gift made to
the said lord. They promised to conveen
the couneil, and give him an answer τ but Χ
the answer is not recorded. The king, “
a‘bout t‘he time that John master· of ‘F or-
bes was put to death, sent the town a ve -
ty kind letter, dated Old Aberdeen Sept'.
ult. of his reign the 25. year 1537,
'which concludes thus, ‘ For we will that
y'e live in liberty and freedom like bur-
gess men, but our thrawing of‚0ut me'n
or great persons, keeping' thie sor your
warrand· -
